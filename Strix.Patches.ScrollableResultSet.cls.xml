<Description>
A patched version of %ScrollableResultSet, to fix some bugs that can't be
worked around in other ways.</Description>

<Method name="PopulateData">
<Description>
PopulateData originates in %ScrollableResultSet, and (if successfull)
calls Close() (from %ResultSet) to close the original query. That method
sets property IsOpened (also from %ResultSet) to 0. The result is that
method OpenObject, which checks for IsOpened, no longer works. The fix
is to set IsOpened back to 1 after PopulateData.</Description>
